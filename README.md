# Online Course Django Application

This is my capstone project for the [Developing Applications with SQL Databases and Django](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developing-applications-with-sql-databases-and-django) course.

## Project Story

In this scenario, you have recently joined a new development team as a full-stack Django developer. The development team has started building a minimum viable product (MVP) of an online course app. 

Based on the user feedback, the stakeholders of the product have planned to add an assessment feature to the online course web app to evaluate learners. For the new assessment feature, instructors should be able to create exams with questions, and learners should be able to complete the course if they pass the exam. 

As a new team member, the lead developer has assigned this new feature to you. You will need to leverage your Django full-stack skills to design and implement models, templates, and views.
